# water-level-indicator
My first IoT-Device to practice some basics. I am using a Wemos D1 Mini, because with the ESP-8266 itÂ´s possible to use a W-LAN connection to publish the data. In my personal case  I measure the distance with an ultrasonic-sensor module, calculate the water-level in my cistern and send it via WiFi and MQTT to a Raspberry with IOBroker and display it with Node-RED.
