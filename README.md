# water-level-indicator-for-water-tank
My first IoT-Device to practice some basics. I am using a Wemos D1 Mini, because with the ESP-8266 itÂ´s possible to use a W-LAN connection to publish the data. In my personal case  I am going to measure the distance with an ultrasonic-sensor module, calculate the water-gauge in my cistern and send it via wireless LAN and MQTT to my personal webserver.
